# Number Guessing Game

The fun and easy project “Number Guessing Game” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer. This project involves the following steps:

- The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
- The user is prompted to enter their guessed number.
- The computer then tells if the entered number matches the generated number or if it is higher/lower than the generated number.
- The game continues until the user guesses the number or runs out of attempts.

## Features

- Limiting the number of attempts.
- Adding multiple rounds.
- Displaying the score after each round.
- Awarding points based on the number of attempts left.
